# Events-On

## Welcome!
This is the start of the development of _Events On_. _Events on_ is a smart phone applicatiom that acts as a tool for any festivals around the world. This app acts as a base of operations for the organisations and a festival guide for the customers. 

## The Goal
The goal is to make organising and attending festivals more convinient then ever by giving people tools on their phone. 

## How do we do it?
- The app will have countless features and options for each organisation to plan and operate a festival. 
- Make everything online so everyone is always connected with each other bring comunicatiom around the team so much easier!
- Fast and simple for everyone! The tools will be complex at times but the way it wil be presented will be very simple and easy to ise for anyone. It will not matter the age or expirience with technology.
- Modern and up-to-date. Smooth animations and nice gui that tells the subject clear and straight forward.

## Who are we?
We are at the moment a singular 16 year old that loves festivals and coding. He can only code in python but is going to develop his knowleadge around everything needed to achive this goal. He is looking to find others that will help him out or join him in this great advebture towards a great festival life! 

## How can you help us?
1. Give suggestions that you may have about this app after reading the features that are already thought of. Read the guidelines for the rules that must be followed
2. Help out with the coding. The language is not yet chosen. However you can suggest what it should use and the reason why. 
3. Show some concept art for the UI of the app. Because the app is going to act and look modern, the UI must be done nicly. 

### If you have any ideas you are more then welcome to sugggest anything! Thanks
