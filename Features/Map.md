# Map
A map for the event but on your phone. Imagine the maps you see all around the event like on sign boards and buildings showing where everything is but on the phone so that no has to look for the map to look for wherever they want to go to.

## Looks
You should go to GUI for more info but it will be like googlemaps but with squares on it that change size depending on how zoomed in the map is. The spuares indicate every shop and area for the event.

## Tiers
1. The whole Event area
2. Districts in the event areas. Like shop district, performace discrict, arts district
3. Smaller specific areas

## Setup
1. Choose a space using a geometric shape on the map. The adress is already given when setting up the whole event entre.*
2. Choose the sub areas in the big shape. Can name each one and give a description for anyone who would need it.
3. Choose each small space that they would put on a normal event map. Differnet types of small thing would be the following:
     - Official  (For the event organiser to reserve the area)
         - We can have common presets like stage, information, entrance etc.
     - Shops (For the personal organisations to reserve a spot.)
         - It should be named somthing like S1, S2, S3 so that its easy for the shop keepers to know which area they have. 
         - They area can be specified what tyoe of thing should be here as well. So if it is in the shop district and they what a hotdog shop specifically here then they could say what they are looking for.
4. The above was using a helpfull step to step guild thingo where the app asks the admin to put the stuff in. However after that it would show the menu where they can tweak everything if they forgot somthing or they need to add somthing.
5. Edit the already pulished.
